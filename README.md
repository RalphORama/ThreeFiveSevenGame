# ThreeFiveSevenGame v1.0   
A simple mathematical game made in Java
This is a simple program for a game I was recently taught how to play. 

The rules are simple:
- Two players per game.
- Players can flip a coin, play Scissors, Paper, Rock, etc to determine who goes first.
- During the player's turn, they can erase any amount of squares in a column.
- Players cannot erase squares from more than one column per turn.

The object of the game is to erase squares in such a way that, at the end of the match, your opponent is left with only one square.

This project needs no special libraries to compile, just JDK 8.
